            <h4><b>Question 1-</b> The following text is adapted from Edith Nesbit’s
                1906 novel The Railway Children. <br> <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull
                <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                [visits] to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                waiting for dull ladies to pay [visits] to her. She <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                was almost always there, ready to play with the <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                children, and read to them, and help them to do <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                their home-lessons. Besides this she used to write <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                stories for them while they were at school, and <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                read them aloud after tea, and she always made <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays and <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                for other great occasions. <br> <br>
                <b>
                    According to the text, what is true about Mother?

            </h4>

            <button class="incorrect" id="a">

                </button></a>
            <p class="feedback3"><br><br> <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ<b> Choice C is the best answer.</b> <br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ Because it describes
                something
                that is true of
                Mother, as presented in the text. The text indicates that in addition to other<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                activities, Mother writes stories for her children while they are at school and
                makes up “funny pieces of poetry” for certain<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ occasions.
                Choice A is incorrect because the text suggests that Mother prefers to spend
                her time with her children and doesn’t<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ sit at home hoping that ladies will visit her.
                Choice B is incorrect because the text says only that Mother makes up poetry
                for the<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ children’s birthdays, not that she likes birthdays more than other special
                occasions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ suggest that Mother
                prefers reading to her children over the other activities she does with them, such
                as playing with them and<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ writing stories and poems for them.

            <p class="feedback4"><br><br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ<b>Choice A is the best answer.</b> Because it most accurately states the
                main purpose
                of the text. In the first part of the text, the speaker<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ addresses Paul Laurence
                Dunbar’s ability to understand people (he has “read the hearts and souls of men”
                and written of their “joy and<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ mirth”). In the second part of the text, the speaker
                describes Dunbar’s thorough understanding of the natural world (he has read “the<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ
                language of the flowers” and engaged with “the little brook”). Thus, the text mainly
                praises Dunbar for being especially perceptive about<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ people and nature.
                Choice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the
                “hearts and souls of men” and the<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ “language of flowers” to convey Dunbar’s ability
                to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read
                any of<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ these things or has read a great deal about them. Choice C is incorrect
                because the text notes how well Dunbar has made sense of the<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ topics he’s written
                about but doesn’t address any specific parts of Dunbar’s writing process beyond
                the suggestion that he used a pen.<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses
                on Dunbar’s understanding of people and nature as expressed in his writing.
                Nothing in<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ the text suggests that the speaker is recalling a particular afternoon
                actually spent in nature with Dunbar; even if there had been a shared<br>ㅤㅤㅤㅤ experience,
                the text isn’t focused on reminiscing.
